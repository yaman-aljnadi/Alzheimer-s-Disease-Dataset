Goal: Predict patient readmission
Sample size: 25000
Response: readmitted
# predictors: 46
# categorical predictors: 35
# numeric predictors: 11
Train/Test split: 80% / 20%
Imputation: kNN (k=5) on numeric after one-hot
Dummy variables: robust OHE via model.matrix with 'Other' mapping; single-level train cats dropped
Near-zero variance removal: applied
Box-Cox: applied after shifting variables to positive; with centering/scaling
High correlation removal: cutoff |r|>0.9; removed 5 predictors
PCA: 39 components for â‰¥95% variance
Spatial sign: alternate train/test set produced
Class imbalance (train): <30/>30/NO counts = 2316/6959/10726
Resampling sets: upsampled and downsampled versions created for model comparison
